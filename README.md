## Forest instances
The majority of these instances are taken from
[FMOS](http://ifmlab.for.unb.ca/fmos/datasets/). Other instances were generated by Carvajal, Constantino, Goycoolea,
Vielma and Weintraub for the paper [*Imposing connectivity constraints in forest planning
models*](https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2013.1183).

For more details on the format of the instances, please contact [Rodolfo Carvajal](rocarvaj.uai.cl).
